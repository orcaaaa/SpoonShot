# Question 3
 ## a)
 As an Intern at SpoonShot, I would have 3 major goals I would like to see through.
 
 Firstly, I am keenly interested in Spoonshot's field of work and there is no better way for me to understand the field of Data Analytics and contribute the field in a meaningful way. 
 I would also learn to grow and thrive in a dynamic and fast paced work environment while gaining invaluable real-world experience in a work ecosystem.
 I would also prepare myself for a future carreer in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning.
 
 After the 8 weeks have passed, I am hoping to have a few important projects under my belt and have made a Social or Even global impact.
 
 ## b)
 I am a Chemical Engineer at IIT Madras and in my first year of college I didn't have a clear idea of what I wanted to do with my life. After speaking to some of my seniors and professors, I started a few online courses on programming and Python in specfic. I Quickly fell in love with programming as I was already very interested in problem solving. I Started attending seminars and workshops on Machine learning and Neural Networks and I realized that this is what I wanted to do in the future. Machine learning and Data science has never been more explored than now. The amount of progress that has been made in this field is truly amazing and there are so many wonderful applications now. I am hoping to explore opportunities in this field. Google's DeepMind was one of the great motivators for me and I've been very intersted in Machine learning being applied in the fiedl of Biology when they solved Protein folding. 

## c)
I am a huge fan of Biology and of Health in general and SpoonShot seemed to be the perfect opportunity for me.
I believe that although the human race is more connected than ever, people are more misinformed and divided now than ever before in History. People choose to ignore facts and data in favour of their irrational beliefs. Major health crises such as obesity and heart issues have been rising at an alarming rate mainly due to people's poor heath choices.
My dream is to see a healthier, happier and more informed society.
In my life I would want to have made a global impact on a socially relevant topic. I want to empower rational and data driven food choices to realize my dreams.
